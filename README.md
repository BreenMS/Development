Posttranscriptional RNA modifications by adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing are abundant in the brain, yet elucidating functional sites remains challenging. To bridge this gap, we expose spatiotemporal and genetically regulated A-to-I editing sites across prenatal and postnatal stages of human brain development. We identify more than 10,000 temporally regulated and spatially conserved editing sites that occur predominately in 3â€™UTRs and introns, as well as 37 sites that recode amino acids in protein coding regions with precise changes in editing levels across development. A massive expansion of RNA hyper-edited transcripts accumulates in the brain well into advanced age, stabilizing RNA secondary structures. These features are conserved in murine and non-human primate models of neurodevelopment. Further, we uncover thousands of cis-editing quantitative trait loci (edQTLs) with unique regulatory effects during prenatal and postnatal development. Collectively, this work offers a highly resolved atlas linking spatiotemporal variation in editing levels to genetic regulatory effects throughout distinct stages of brain maturation.  <br /> <br /> 

Here we provide all computational code, supplemental tables, and intermediate data files used to generate all results and figures in this body of work. 

# This work entails four main levels of analysis:
1. Compute an Alu Editing Index (AEI) from a STAR mapped bam file  [(RNAEditingIndexer v1.0)](https://github.com/a2iEditing/RNAEditingIndexer)<br /> 
2. Quantifying RNA editing sites from STAR mapped bam files using de novo methods [(reditools v2.0)](https://github.com/tizianoflati/reditools2.0)<br /> 
3. Quantifying RNA editing from STAR mapped bam files using a list of predefined list of sites (code provided below)<br /> 
4. Quantifying RNA hyper-editing sites from STAR unmapped fastq files [(method based on Porath et al., 2017)](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1315-y)<br /> 

# 1. Compute AEI from a STAR mapped bam file:
We used already available software from the [RNAEditingIndexer GitHub account](https://github.com/a2iEditing/RNAEditingIndexer) to compute an AEI based on a mapped bam file. The method is describe in the original publication, [Nat. Methods (2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31636457/). Here, we provide an example of bash shell script that executes the AEI on one sample. Requirements and parameters are described in full in the bash script.  <br /> 
 
```ruby
An example for running computing the AEI on human samples:
RNAEditingIndex -d -f -o .
--genes_expression ucscHg38GTExGeneExpression.bed.gz
--refseq ucscHg38RefSeqCurated.bed.gz
--snps ucscHg38CommonGenomicSNPs150.bed.gz
-gf ucscHg38Genome.fa
-rb ucscHg38Alu.bed.gz
--genome UserProvided  --paired_end --stranded

```
<br />  

# 2. Quantify RNA editing sites from STAR mapped bam files using de novo methods:
We used already available software from the [reditools v2.0 GitHub account](https://github.com/tizianoflati/reditools2.0) to quantify de novo RNA editing sites based on a STAR mapped bam file. The method is describe in the original publication, [BMC Bioinformatics (2020)](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-03562-x). Here, we provide an example of bash shell script that executes reditools 2.0 on one sample. Requirements and parameters are described in full in the bash script.  <br /> 

```ruby
reditools_caller.sh
```

<br />  


# 3. Quantify RNA editing from STAR mapped bam files using a list of predefined list of sites (based on a predefined list of sites):
It is often of interest to quantify RNA editing sites based on a user defined list of sites. Samtools mpileup has the functionality to execute this task. Here we provide two perl scripts that will achieve this task. The only requirement is installing a recent version of samtools.  <br /> 


query_known_sites.pl= excute mpileup (samtools) to query a list of known editing sites.<br />
parse_pileup_query.pl = a requirement for query_known_sites.pl<br />  
Usage: perl query_known_sites.pl [A predefined list of known editing sites] [STAR mapped bam file] [Output file name]
```ruby
perl query_known_sites.pl CNS_A2G_events.txt SampleName.bam OutputFileName.txt
```
<br />  

# Helpful data files:
CNS_A2G_events.txt = A predefined list of 166,215 A-to-I RNA editing sites detected within each cell population.<br /> 
CNS_A2G_15221edits.txt = A matrix of 15,221 RNA editing sites we detected across all three cell populations.<br /> 

<br />  

# 4. Quantifying RNA hyper-editing sites from STAR unmapped fastq files:
We used already available software from the [RNA hyper-editing GitHub account](https://github.com/hagitpt/Hyper-editing) to quantify RNA hyper-editing sites based on a STAR unmapped fastq files. The method is describe in the original publication, [Genome Biology (2017)](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1315-y). We provide a detailed example of how we execute this pipeline providing all code, with minor modifications, at [Ryn Cuddleston's GitHub account](https://github.com/ryncuddleston/RNA-hyper-editing) .  <br />
